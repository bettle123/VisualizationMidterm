This is my Vislualization midterm project.
Our topic is Airline On-Time Performance and Causes of Flight Delays.
1. Designed UI to let users select their interested flight and Illustrated the flights information (delay probability, delay time).
2. Visualized and analyzed time series plot of on-time and delayed flights.
There are some screenshots for demonstration.
